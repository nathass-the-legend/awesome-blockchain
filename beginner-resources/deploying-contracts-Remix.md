# Compiling and Deploying Solidity Smart Contracts Using the Remix IDE
For those of you who are new to blockchain development and specifically smart contracts, there is an amazing tool for compiling and deploying Solidity contracts, the Remix  IDE. You can access the Remix IDE at [remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Remix allows you to compile and deploy Solidity contracts to a local blockchain, testnets such as Ethereum Sepolia and Avalanche Fuji or mainnet chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum.
