The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value (by [Don Tapscott](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-generation-internet-surprise-its-all-don-tapscott)).

## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.s) & Answers

**Q: What's a Blockchain?**

A: A blockchain is a distributed database with a list (that is, chain) of records (that is, blocks) linked and secured by
digital fingerprints (that is, crypto hashes).
Example from [`genesis_block.json`](https://github.com/yjjnls/awesome-blockchain/tree/master/src/js/genesis_block.json):

```js
{
    "version": 0,
    "height": 1,
    "previous_hash": null,
    "timestamp": 1550049140488,
    "merkle_hash": null,
    "generator_publickey": "18941c80a77f2150107cdde99486ba672b5279ddd469eeefed308540fbd46983",
    "hash": "d611edb9fd86ee234cdc08d9bf382330d6ccc721cd5e59cf2a01b0a2a8decfff",
    "block_signature": "603b61b14348fb7eb087fe3267e28abacadf3932f0e33958fb016ab60f825e3124bfe6c7198d38f8c91b0a3b1f928919190680e44fbe7289a4202039ffbb2109",
    "consensus_data": {},
    "transactions": []
}
```

**Q: What's a Hash? What's a (One-Way) Crypto(graphic) Hash Digest Checksum**?

A: A hash e.g. `d611edb9fd86ee234cdc08d9bf382330d6ccc721cd5e59cf2a01b0a2a8decfff`
is a small digest checksum calculated
with a one-way crypto(graphic) hash digest checksum function
e.g. SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256 Bits)
from the data. Example from [`crypto.js`](https://github.com/yjjnls/awesome-blockchain/blob/master/src/js/crypto.js):

```js
function calc_hash(data) {
    return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(data).digest('hex');
}
```

A blockchain uses

-   the block header (e.g. `Version`, `TimeStamp`, `Previous Hash...` )and
-   the block data (e.g. `Transaction Data...`)

to calculate the new hash digest checksum.

**Q: What's a Merkle Tree?**

A: A Merkle tree is a hash tree named after Ralph Merkle who patented the concept in 1979
(the patent expired in 2002). A hash tree is a generalization of hash lists or hash chains where every leaf node (in the tree) is labelled with a data block and every non-leaf node (in the tree)
is labelled with the crypto(graphic) hash of the labels of its child nodes. For more see the [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) Wikipedia Article.

Note: By adding crypto(graphic) hash functions you can "merkelize" any data structure.

**Q: What's a Merkelized DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)?**

A: It's a blockchain secured by crypto(graphic) hashes that uses a directed acyclic graph data structure (instead of linear "classic" linked list).

Note: Git uses merkelized dag (directed acyclic graph)s for its blockchains.
